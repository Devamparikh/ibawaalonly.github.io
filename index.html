			<p> A true Friend is the greatest gift of our life which is hard to find and once you get never let him go. ‘A friend in need is a friend indeed’ this famous quote is completely accomplishes the meaning of true friendship as true friends are always stand by you when you are in need. Friends who prove the closest, dearest, loyal, faithful and the best companion are called true friends.

				In these tough times we count on friend to help us get through. I like to think of friendship as everlasting, but is friendship truly forever? Can miles drive you away from friends you made after graduating from places like high school or college? Just imagine walking across the stage and never seeing the people you graduated with. Well for those instances you can always join networking places like Facebook.  Facebook helps you connect with the people in your life. In those ways you would never be without your friends.

				A friendship can be everlasting depending on the personalities in that relationship. Sometimes personalities can change for the good the bad in many friendships. You can never change a person through a friendship. Differences can set you apart. The definition of a friend has changed over the years therefore that could be a contributing factor to why we can count our friend on one hand. Think about it! When separating from friends for a while physically values and beliefs start to change. Many may argue that is not true, but I will say I have lost many friends do to personality changes and belief.
