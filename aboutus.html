	A good friend‘s company always matters a lot in the success of a person. A child learns good or bad habits from his or her friend but if one gets good company as friend he is the luckiest person in word.

	The person who cheats you, talks behind your back and laughs at you can never be your true friend. Friendship is the relation where friends listen and try to understand each other’s problems.

	We can’t live our life alone we need a friend on every stage of it. Any relation can be stronger if it adds friendship in to this for example a father or a mother can be the first friend.
</p>
<p style="background-color: yellow;">
	True friends are always caring, loving, loyal, passionate, a little bit critic and most importantly trustworthy towards their friends. These qualities make a friend as a good friend.

	Friendship has never bounded by people’s financial status. A king can be a true friend of a poor beggar and a poor labour can be a good friend of a rich industrialist.
